Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in 1890 in the family home in
Angell Street, Providence, Rhode Island. Except for short holidays
and a disastrous couple of years in New York, Lovecraft stayed close
to home and buried himself in antiquarian studies of New England.
He lived in the oldest settlements of the first Puritan arrivals in
America, and Lovecraft fashioned himself as an old Colonial, a man
out of time, writing letters in stilted eighteenth-century English, imitating the poetics of those Enlightenment wits Addison and Steele,
signing off his letters with 'God Save the King!' in defiance of this
newfangled American Republic. Lovecraft was born into America at
the moment that it became a world power, yet he lived and wrote with
his back turned steadfastly against the American century.
Whilst Lovecraft adored Colonial era houses, pottering about New
England on pilgrimages to notable survivals, his obsession with the
past was never retreat. The inheritance of New England was ambiguous. The Puritans wanted to throw off priestcraft and establish the
kingdom of God. To clear the ground for that celestial city, they
slaughtered Native Americans and built the nation on the backs of
African slaves. The sublime wilderness pressed in on their feeble
footholds. And the settlers only brought their fallen ways with them.
In Salem, a place Lovecraft visited and used as the basis for his fictional town Arkham, the notorious witch-hunts turned the community against itself in a fever of denunciation in 1692. Nineteen people
were hanged as witches on Gallows Hill before the grip of paranoia
eased. The great American Gothic writer Nathaniel Hawthorne was
haunted by the fact that an ancestor had served as one of the hanging
judges; the threat of such a guilty inheritance was the subject of his
Gothic romance, The House o/Seven Gables. Ancestral horrors lurked
in the family trees of New England. This was the direct theme of
Lovecraft's 'The Shadow over Innsmouth', because for him these
inheritances were intensely personal.
Introduction IX
Lovecraft was the last descendant of two notable New England
families. In 1893, his father collapsed with paresis, and spent the
remaining years of his life in an asylum. Paresis was the degenerative
muscular weakness that was associated with the late stages of syphilis,
the then incurable sexually transmitted disease in which spirochaetes
devour the nervous system over long years of decline. The disease
was regarded as a moral failing and hushed up. It was also transmissible to children, and H. P. Lovecraft must have lived under the
shadow of the disease. In 1896, his grandmother died, prompting the
young Lovecraft to suffer horrifying nightmares mixed up with his
already precocious reading of Milton's Paradise Lost, in an edition
illustrated with images of hell by Gustav Don!.
Childhood trauma was compounded by the death of his grandfather in 1904. Whipple Phillips was the last tie to hereditary family
wealth, and reduced circumstances forced the family to leave the
ancestral home and move into a smaller property. It left Lovecraft
feeling exiled for the rest of his life and this event drove his antiquarian and genealogical fascinations. Lovecraft was a sickly child, nervous illnesses disrupting his schooling to an extent that he could not
graduate to attend Brown University in Providence. A breakdown at
18 left him a recluse in his mother's home for several years. In letters
Lovecraft declared himself a neurotic: 'Nervous exhaustion always
intervenes between me and success,' he said: 'I am only about halfalive ... My nervous system is a shattered wreck.'2 In an attempt to
escape, Lovecraft tried to join the army in 1917, even while suspecting that basic training would kill him before he got to the trenches in
France. His mother intervened with military authorities and
Lovecraft was declared permanently unfit for service. Family catastrophe was crowned by his mother's mental collapse in 1919 from
nervous debility. She died in a sanatorium two years later.
After his mother's death, Lovecraft's health improved, yet he must
have identified himself as a Decadent. One of Lovecraft's favourite
Poe stories was 'The Fall of the House of Usher', featuring Roderick
Usher, the last, peculiarly sensitive member of his ancient family.
Although Lovecraft disliked the work of French DecadentJoris-Karl
Huysmans, Lovecraft's life recalls the anti-hero of his strange nove


Lovecraftian Philosophy
At its best, Lovecraft's moments of oscillation between the sublime
and grotesque approach metaphysical intensity. 'The Call ofCthulhu'
opens with the statement: 'The most merciful thing in the world,
I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of
infinity' (p. 24). The narrator of ' At the Mountains of Madness' experiences a similar collapse of worldview as his 'accustomed conception
of external nature and nature's laws' is destroyed (p. 207). For many
readers, one of the key pleasures of Lovecraft's work is the way
the fiction becomes a vehicle for the dramatization of a rigorous
philosophy.
Lovecraft was well versed in scientific materialism. He read the
biologist Ernst Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe with admiration.

XXlI Introduction
The book argued that Darwinism had made it clear that there was
only one order of reality and thus stripped humanity of any
metaphysical illusions of soul or transcendental order. Lovecraft
read Schopenhauer's pessimistic account of blind striving Will and
Nietzsche's splenetic relativization of Christian morals. The strand
of pessimism was strong in Lovecraft's thinking, and was voiced in
the late 1920S by Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West, an influential account of the cyclical decline of Western culture, in accord
with iron laws of determinism. Drafted in the Great War and published in Germany in the crisis conditions of the 19205, Spengler's
philosophy of history inverted many values: civilization marked the
death throes of culture, not its apotheosis; imperialism was the last
decadence, 'a doom, something daemonic'; the great metropolitan
city was the sign of imminent collapse of a race. All of this spoke
directly to Lovecraft and is everywhere apparent in his fiction.
His philosophical pessimism was tinged by cynicism, arguing for
maintaining certain illusions to pacify what Lovecraft called 'the
herd'. Lovecraft praised Joseph Wood Krutch's book, The Modern
Temper, for its fearless expression of the shattering effect of modern
science. Krutch suggested that mythology, religion, and metaphysics
had 'all collapsed under the face of successive attacks' since the nineteenth century, leaving the West haunted 'by ghosts from a dead
world and not yet at home in its own'. To avoid chaos, Krutch suggested a need to maintain traditions however hollowed out of meaning. This was a stance Lovecraft often adopted: 'Tradition means
nothing cosmically, but it means everything locally and pragmatically
because we have nothing else to shield us from the devastating sense
of "lostness" in endless space and time. '14
The clearest position Lovecraft came to articulate, though, was
cosmic indifferentism. In an important letter to the editor of Weird
Tales, resubmitting 'The Call of Cthulhu' for consideration,
Lovecraft said:
Now all my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common
human laws and interests and emotions have no validity or significance
in the vast cosmos-at-Iarge. To me there is nothing but puerility in a tale
in which the human form-and the local human passions and conditions
and standards-are depicted as native to other worlds or other universes.

Introduction XXlll
To achieve the essence of real externality, whether of time or space or
dimension, one must forget that such things as organic life, good and evil,
love and hate, and all such local attributes of a negligible and temporary
race called mankind have any existence at all.
This was a strictly in-human stance, a different emphasis from the
cynical or pessimistic strands of Lovecraft's thinking. 'Contrary to
what you may assume,' he said in a later letter, 'I am not a pessimist but
an indifferentist-that is, 1 don't make the mistake of thinking that the
resultant of natural forces surrounding and governing organic life
will have any connexion with the wishes or tastes of any part of that
organic life-process. Pessimists are just as illogical as optimists ...
Both schools retain in a vestigial way the primitive concept ... of a
cosmos which gives a damn one way or the other. 'IS This philosophy
appears fitfully in Lovecraft's actual fiction, but supplies some of his
most chilling moments of climax. It is a stance that is allergic to every
moral or humanistic defence of the purpose of literature explored by
his contemporaries.
Modern philosophers have expanded on the radical possibilities of
Lovecraft's stance. His fiction has been read as an attempt to think
outside the subject and give priority to the weirdness of the object
world, making Lovecraft a key figure for thinkers like Graham
Harman and Eugene Thacker. 'The weird is the discovery of an
un human limit to thought, that is nevertheless foundational for
thought,' Thacker suggests, defining Lovecraftian horror as an
attempt to think about 'the world-with out-us' .16 Whilst exploring 'real
externality' in these abstract, philosophical ways, Lovecraft's 'weird
realism' is also a particular reflection on his times.
Pulp Fiction for a Morbid Age
By Armistice Day in 1918, it was estimated that ten million military
personnel has been killed in the Great War. Civilian deaths were
nearly as high, and the catastrophe was compounded by the outbreak
of 'Spanish flu' which killed many millions more between 1918
and 1920. There was a widespread view among intellectuals that the

XXIV Introduction
Great War marked the end of European culture: the 'suicide of civilization' was a common phrase. The Treaty ofVersaiIles, signed in June
19 I 9, which forced punitive reparations on Germany, sowed the seeds
for collapse and the rise of extreme politics across Europe. Amidst
civil war in Russia following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, a
meeting of Communist parties announced the principles of the Third
International as the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie, by
armed force if necessary. In America, paranoia about immigrants
bringing Bolshevism into the country meant that 'nonconformist
aliens' were targeted by legislation and persecution in the Red Scare
of 1919. One English journalist called America 'hag-ridden by the
spectre of Bolshevism. It was like a sleeper in a nightmare, enveloped
by a thousand phantoms of destruction.' As capitalism tottered, the
authoritarian Fascist solution to crisis found power first in Italy and
then in Germany. From his prison cell in Italy, the Marxist Antonio
Gramsci composed the famous epigram: 'The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in
this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.'
We can count Lovecraft's fiction amongst these symptoms. I
