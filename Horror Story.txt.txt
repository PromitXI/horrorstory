Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in 1890 in the family home in
Angell Street, Providence, Rhode Island. Except for short holidays
and a disastrous couple of years in New York, Lovecraft stayed close
to home and buried himself in antiquarian studies of New England.
He lived in the oldest settlements of the first Puritan arrivals in
America, and Lovecraft fashioned himself as an old Colonial, a man
out of time, writing letters in stilted eighteenth-century English, imitating the poetics of those Enlightenment wits Addison and Steele,
signing off his letters with 'God Save the King!' in defiance of this
newfangled American Republic. Lovecraft was born into America at
the moment that it became a world power, yet he lived and wrote with
his back turned steadfastly against the American century.
Whilst Lovecraft adored Colonial era houses, pottering about New
England on pilgrimages to notable survivals, his obsession with the
past was never retreat. The inheritance of New England was ambiguous. The Puritans wanted to throw off priestcraft and establish the
kingdom of God. To clear the ground for that celestial city, they
slaughtered Native Americans and built the nation on the backs of
African slaves. The sublime wilderness pressed in on their feeble
footholds. And the settlers only brought their fallen ways with them.
In Salem, a place Lovecraft visited and used as the basis for his fictional town Arkham, the notorious witch-hunts turned the community against itself in a fever of denunciation in 1692. Nineteen people
were hanged as witches on Gallows Hill before the grip of paranoia
eased. The great American Gothic writer Nathaniel Hawthorne was
haunted by the fact that an ancestor had served as one of the hanging
judges; the threat of such a guilty inheritance was the subject of his
Gothic romance, The House o/Seven Gables. Ancestral horrors lurked
in the family trees of New England. This was the direct theme of
Lovecraft's 'The Shadow over Innsmouth', because for him these
inheritances were intensely personal.
Introduction IX
Lovecraft was the last descendant of two notable New England
families. In 1893, his father collapsed with paresis, and spent the
remaining years of his life in an asylum. Paresis was the degenerative
muscular weakness that was associated with the late stages of syphilis,
the then incurable sexually transmitted disease in which spirochaetes
devour the nervous system over long years of decline. The disease
was regarded as a moral failing and hushed up. It was also transmissible to children, and H. P. Lovecraft must have lived under the
shadow of the disease. In 1896, his grandmother died, prompting the
young Lovecraft to suffer horrifying nightmares mixed up with his
already precocious reading of Milton's Paradise Lost, in an edition
illustrated with images of hell by Gustav Don!.
Childhood trauma was compounded by the death of his grandfather in 1904. Whipple Phillips was the last tie to hereditary family
wealth, and reduced circumstances forced the family to leave the
ancestral home and move into a smaller property. It left Lovecraft
feeling exiled for the rest of his life and this event drove his antiquarian and genealogical fascinations. Lovecraft was a sickly child, nervous illnesses disrupting his schooling to an extent that he could not
graduate to attend Brown University in Providence. A breakdown at
18 left him a recluse in his mother's home for several years. In letters
Lovecraft declared himself a neurotic: 'Nervous exhaustion always
intervenes between me and success,' he said: 'I am only about halfalive ... My nervous system is a shattered wreck.'2 In an attempt to
escape, Lovecraft tried to join the army in 1917, even while suspecting that basic training would kill him before he got to the trenches in
France. His mother intervened with military authorities and
Lovecraft was declared permanently unfit for service. Family catastrophe was crowned by his mother's mental collapse in 1919 from
nervous debility. She died in a sanatorium two years later.
After his mother's death, Lovecraft's health improved, yet he must
have identified himself as a Decadent. One of Lovecraft's favourite
Poe stories was 'The Fall of the House of Usher', featuring Roderick
Usher, the last, peculiarly sensitive member of his ancient family.
Although Lovecraft disliked the work of French DecadentJoris-Karl
Huysmans, Lovecraft's life recalls the anti-hero of his strange nove
